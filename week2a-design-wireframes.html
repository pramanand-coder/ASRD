 <p>It used to be the case that everyone viewed web pages on about the same size screen - a desktop 
computer. But now it is just as likely that someone will be using a smart phone, tablet, or assistive technology 
to access the Internet. Therefore, people viewing your site will now expect that it will perform regardless of the 
device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, or screen reader) AND take into account some common 
personal settings such as color schemes. This ability to respond to any platform and user preferences is called 
Responsive Design.
 This course will expand upon the basic knowledge of CSS3 to include topics such as wireframes, fluid design, 
media queries, and the use of existing styling paradigms. After the course, learners will be able to:
 ** Explain the mobile-first paradigm and the importance of wireframes in the design phase
 ** Create sites that behave across a range of platforms
 ** Recognize existing design frameworks such as Bootstrap
 A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class, so it can be taken third or 
fourth in the Web Design for Everybody specialization. Additional courses focus on adding interactivity with the 
JavaScript Programming Language and completing a capstone project.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur

 <h2>Wireframes</h2>
 <p>The same screen can be built in a lot of different ways, but only a few of them will get your message 
across correctly and result in an easy-to-use software or website.
 The purpose of a wireframe is to define a skeletal layout that is easy to understand, and encourages 
iteration and feedback. Getting to agreement on a good interface structure is a critical part of the software 
design process.
 Wireframes are important because doing this work now, before any code is written and before the visual 
design is finalized, will save you lots of time and painful adjustment work later.
 The primary reason for wireframing is to generate and communicate ideas, so making wireframes is not 
limited to any single role or specialization in an organization.
