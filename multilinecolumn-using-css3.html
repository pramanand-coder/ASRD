        There is the administrative side of the entire incident and, hopefully a proper investigation will bring to books and punish those directly or indirectly responsible for causing this tragedy. But, when a tragedy of this magnitude happens, the political underbelly that is hand in glove with such negligence and exploitation must also not go unnoticed and unaccounted for. Hopefully, those links will also be exposed, and proper action will be taken.
        However, what cannot be ignored is how a conniving, but supposedly ‘bhola’ individual, could succeed in 
        ‘luring’ innocent, illiterate, and in every way ‘bholi’ public to pay obeisance to him in the manner it 
        did.
